I am a data scientist based in New York. Currently, I'm working as a Programmer & Data Analyst for the [Yale Data-Driven Environmental Solutions Group](http://datadriven.yale.edu) (Data-Driven Yale) .

Professionally, I work on issues related to sustainability, energy efficiency, affordable housing, and real estate.

In my spare time, you can find me watching baseball and reading about sabermetrics.
