I am a data scientist based in New York. Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist for the Center for NYC Neighborhoods.

Professionally, I work on issues related to sustainability, energy efficiency, and real estate.

In my spare time, you can find me watching baseball and reading about sabermetrics.
