I am a data scientist based in New York. Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist for the [Trase](https://trase.earth) project at the [Stockholm Environment Institute](https://www.sei.org).

Previously, I worked as a data scientist for the [Data-Driven Environmental Solutions Group at Yale University](https://datadrivenlab.org) and on energy efficiency in real estate for the [Institute for Market Transformation](https://www.imt.org).

Professionally, I work on issues related to sustainability, energy efficiency, affordable housing, and real estate.

In my spare time, you can find me watching baseball and reading about sabermetrics.
